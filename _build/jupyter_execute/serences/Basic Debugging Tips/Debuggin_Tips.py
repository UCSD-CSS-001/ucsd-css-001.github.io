# # Basic debugging tips

# * If your functions arenâ€™t working as expected, use the following debugging techniques:
#   * Print each of the inputs and their types to make sure your inputs are correct. Use the type() function to get a variables type.
#   * Come up with test cases whose answers you can calculate manually and then check if your function outputs the same answers.
#   * Make sure you are returning the output of your function.
# To debug loops, print the variables that are changing in your loop and do so by formatting them in well written print statements.
#   * Use good variable names. Long variable names are any day better than short and uninformative ones.
#   * When you google, make sure you are searching for Python 3 stuff, not Python 2!
#   * At the end, Restart and Run all cells to make sure everything is working as expected.
# 

# ## printing things out...
# * easiest way to debug, and super useful for simple applications
# * e.g. here we want to square a list of numbers, but we make a mistake. Instead of for i in nums (which is what we want), we loop over the length of nums (for i in range(len(nums))). So instead of squaring the actual list of numbers, we are squaring 0,1,2...N, where N is the length of the list of numbers
# * inserting a simple print statement to show us what 'i' is each time we go through the loop is super helpful...
#   * allows us to see that i is 0,1 instead of 10,12...

# write a function to square a variable length list of numbers
def sqr_list(*nums):
  out = []
  for i in range(len(nums)):
    print("i is:", i)
    out.append(i**2)
    
  return out


# In[2]:


sqr_list(10,12)


# ## use the %pdb "line magic" [more on line magics next week, but they basically add functionality in the ipython notebook environment]
# * good for when you're getting an error and not sure why
# * %pdb 1 will turn the debugger on
# * %pdb 0 will turn the debugger off
# * will stop execution at the error and enter "debug" mode
#   * this will launch a 'command line', and at the command line you can type in variable names and do other operations to test your code
# * type 'q' at the command line to exit debugging mode

  return out

# ## One built in debugger using: pdb.set_trace()
# * will set a breakpoint at a fixed location
# * when breakpoint reached, you will enter debug mode and a command line will pop up similar to the one you get with %pdb 1 line magic
