# # P02: Control flow and logic
# 
# Computer programs become very powerful once we can command their flow of execution.  This is done via two primary control structures:
# 
# - Conditionals (`if...elif...else`) statements that allow the program execution to *branch*, and
# - Loops (`for` and `while`) that allow the program execution to *repeat*.
# 
# 
# - conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
# - comparison operators
# - logic operators
# - for loops
# - while loops
