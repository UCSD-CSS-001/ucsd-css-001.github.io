## What's hard about programming?

If you have never written a computer program before, you will find computer programming to be difficult.  Programming a computer requires   
1. figuring out what computation solves the problem you want to solve   
2. specifying what steps to follow to perform that computation, and   
3. explaining those steps to a computer.  

When you write your first program, 1 will be solved for you, 2 will be trivial, and 3 will seem quite hard.  
As you get better at programming, and the programs you write become more complicated, 3 will become fairly easy, while 2 will prove to be quite difficult.
Eventually, most of the difficulty will end up in 1.  

## Learning to program

- Programming means giving a computer instructions about what steps to follow to perform some calculation.  

- Computers are very stupid.  They do *exactly* what you tell them; no more, no less.  No matter how dumb it is.  
  
- If a computer does something wrong, it is because you told it to do the wrong thing.

- Learning to program means learning to be as stupid as a computer.  It's about figuring out what calculation to do to solve the problem you are interested in, and then explaining those steps to the idiot computer. 


### Example: 

You want to instruct me to send a new post to the class with the message "hi" using the campuswire website.  The trick is that (1) you have to write all the instructions out ahead of time, and (2) I only understand a limited set of commands:

- move mouse {left, right, up, down} (distance in cm, on my screen)   
- click mouse
- press (keyboard button)    

Some observations about what makes this hard:  
- cannot observe intermediate state.     
- my representation differs from yours, and you have to give me instructions in my representation.  
- a priori unknown state model.  
- tedious level of precision required because I don't understand more sophisticated commands.  

Computer programming presents the same challenges: we need to write out very detailed instructions, using a very limited, literal, set of commands.  We need to write the instructions out in advance.
