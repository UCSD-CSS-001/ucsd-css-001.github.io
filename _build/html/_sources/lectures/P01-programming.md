## Procedural vs Declarative knowledge

## What's hard about programming?

If you have never written a computer program before, you will find computer programming to be difficult.  Programming a computer requires   
1. figuring out what computation solves the problem you want to solve   
2. specifying what steps to follow to perform that computation, and   
3. explaining those steps to a computer.  

When you write your first program, 1. will be solved for you, 2. will be trivial, and 3. will seem quite hard.  
As you get better at programming and the programs you write become more complicated, 3. will become fairly easy, while 2. will prove to be quite difficult.  

beginners think they dont know what code to write, but really dont know what they are trying to do, what problem they are trying to solve.

<!---
For some technical domains limited by the speed or capacity of computers, 2. continues to be hard, because success is limited by the efficiency of the algorithms.  But in many applied settings, eventually it turns out that the primary challenge is in 1: figuring out what you want to do at all.

## Learning to program

- Programming means giving a computer instructions about what steps to follow to perform some calculation.  

- Computers are very stupid.  They do *exactly* what you tell them; no more, no less.  No matter how dumb it is.  
  
- If a computer does something wrong, it is because you told it to do the wrong thing.

- Learning to program means learning to be as stupid as a computer.  It's about figuring out what calculation to do to solve the problem you are interested in, and then explaining those steps to the idiot computer.

## What a computer does

- get some input data (from a file? a prompt? variables?)  
- stores the data in memory    
- changes and combines the data in various ways
- outputs the contents somehow

### Basic operations

#### Input: 

- ask user for input
- read data from file on disk
- download data from URL

#### Store data

- create a new variable named ?, 

### meta learning
- secret is algorithms and data
- concepts first, code later.
- 
- comments are code... code explains comments to computer.

### eight main concepts
phrase as active sentence.
- new variable: name? type? initial value?
- output: message?
- input: variable (to store)?, message (to prompt)?
...discover...
- convert...
- while loop (requires more logic!)
- for loop (sentry, start, finish, change)
- lists and tuples
- string manipulation
- built in help
- list iteration
- functions and scope, and paramters, and return
- objects....
- eventually...


### how a computer reads / interprets a program
parts: 
variables: declaration & asignment (types?)
control flow: conditionals, loops, exceptions.  
functions:
connection to outside world: 



### important computer programming concepts: 
declarative vs imperative knowledge
variable
function
operator
object
data types


### basics of a computer system

data structures
algorithms


## Types of programming languages

- python is: a programming language
