# Announcements (2021-06-29)


Dear Professor Vul,

My name is Yvonne Ngo, Tutor Coordinator with the Academic Achievement Hub. We are offering a “How to Learn” workshop for your students this Summer. The workshop provides students study skills and strategies for learning how to program.

These workshops also provide your students another space to build a community with their peers in the course. We have designed these sessions to be highly engaging for students to build their skills with the guidance of our experienced content tutors.

Attached are flyers with information for upcoming workshop. We would greatly appreciate your support to advocate for students to attend our workshops through announcements in class or Canvas. Students can sign up for as many sessions as they would like. More information can be found at aah.ucsd.edu.

Copied in this message is the Assistant Tutor Coordinator, Maggie Mastrolorenzo. Both of us are happy to answer any questions you may have regarding the workshops.

Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Yvonne Ngo
