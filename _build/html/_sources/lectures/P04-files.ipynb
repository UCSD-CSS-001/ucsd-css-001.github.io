    "# P04: Reading and writing files\n",
    "- **Python files**: open, close, with open as fp\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding a file\n",
    "\n",
    "- Files are stored somewhere in your computer systems hard drive or storage area.\n",
    "\n",
    "- That location is specified via a file **path**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A file path encodes the location of the file within the directory structure on the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Absolute* file paths encode the location of the file relative to the root, or base directory of the file system.  So let's say we have a file named `filename.ext` located in `folder2`, which is located inside `jserences`, which is inside `Users`, which is in the base (root) directory of the file system.  On a unix machine (such as Mac OS, Linux, etc.) this location is encoded as follows `/Users/jserences/folder2/filename.ext` where the slashes (`/`) indicates directories or folders. Windows machines use the forward slash `\\`, so that path would look something like `C:\\Users\\jserences\\folder2\\filename.ext`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Relative* file paths encode the location of the file relative to the current location or path, where the program is running. So if a program has been launched in the folder `/Users/jserences/programs/`, then the relative path to `/Users/jserences/folder2/filename.ext` would involve going up one directory in the file tree using the `..` syntax, then down into `folder2` and getting `filename.ext`.  The full relative path would be `../folder2/filename.ext`.  The key part here is that `..` move you up one level in the directory tree **relative** to the the current working directory. Basically `..` is like pressing the `back` arrow on a 'Finder' window when you're moving around using the mouse and the windows provided by your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening a file\n",
    "\n",
    "- Files are accessed via the `open(file, mode)` command, specifying the (relative or absolute) path to the  file, and the mode with which you want to open it ('r' for read, 'w' for write, 'a' for append, there are [more](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Opening a file creates a file object which can be read from (or written to, or appended to, depending on what mode you used to open it).  \n",
    "    - Assuming we are dealing with text files, `file.read()` reads the entire content of the file as one string. \n",
    "    - `file.readlines()` reads the entire content of the file as a list of strings, with each element corresponding to one line in the text file.  \n",
    "    - `file.readline()` reads one line at a time, and is helpful if your file is large, and you do not want to load its entirety into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you open a file, your operating system is notified that some program is doing something to that file, and it will prevent other changes from being made to that file. Consequently, it is important that you *close* the file after opening it.  In Python, the easiest way to make this that this is done without errors is via the `with` keyword, that creates a temporary context in which the file is open, and then closes the file as soon as all the operations that need to be carried out on the file are completed. Bad things can happen if you do not close the file, so make sure you're careful with this (the file might get corrupted, you might find that nothing was written to the file, etc). "

It was\\n', 'already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the\\n', 'panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the\\n', 'half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature\\n', 'open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.\\n', '\\n', 'How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate\\n', 'the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to\\n', 'form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as\\n', 'beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered\\n', 'the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous\\n', 'black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these\\n', 'luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,\\n', 'that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which\\n', 'they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.\\n', '\\n', 'The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings\\n', 'of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole\\n', 'purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had\\n', 'deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour\\n', 'that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty\\n', 'of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my\\n', 'heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I\\n', 'rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my\\n', 'bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude\\n', 'succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the\\n', 'bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.\\n', 'But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest\\n', 'dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in\\n', 'the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,\\n', 'but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with\\n', 'the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I\\n', 'held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her\\n', 'form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.\\n', 'I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my\\n', 'teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and\\n', 'yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window\\n', 'shutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had\\n', 'created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they\\n', 'may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some\\n', 'inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have\\n', 'spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to\\n', 'detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the\\n', 'courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained\\n', 'during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest\\n', 'agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if\\n', 'it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I\\n']\n"
