# Expectations

**Computational Social Science (CSS)** uses **computation** to understand **social phenomena**.  "Using computation" means giving a computer very precise instructions about what steps to follow to calculate something of interest.  This is what it means to "program" a computer.  So to do CSS, you have to learn to program computers.  

**In this class you will learn to write computer programs in [Python](https://www.python.org/).**  The following are all consequences of this primary goal:  

- **High variability:** Students have very different levels of prior experience with programming, so the material in this class will be easy for some, and difficult for others.
  
- **Lots of practice:** There are many small assignments, rather than a few large tests.  
  
- **Objective evaluation:** (Simple) computer programs either work as intended or not.  

- **Scale effort not grades:** All students can get a good grade, but students who find the material new and difficult will have to spend more time and exert more effort.  

- **Effort required:** For many students, this course requires more effort than most social science courses.  To succeed you need to start assignments early, work consistently, and persevere through failure.
