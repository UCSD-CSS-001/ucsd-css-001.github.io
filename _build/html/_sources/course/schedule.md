# Schedule

This class is divided into 10 parts, corresponding to the normal 10 weeks of the academic year.
During summer session, we cover two parts per week (one per day).  
Each week has a problem set motivating (and testing) the material that we cover that week.

## Week 1.  Basics
**Problem Set**: convert list of heights in different units into a common representation.

### p. 1: introduction, orientation, basics
- **Concepts**: how to talk to a computer, syntax, debugging, running in your head
- **Jupyter notebooks**: basic navigation, markdown formatting, ipython magics: %who, %whos  
- **Python basics**: syntax, names, arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, **, %), literals & basic data types (int, float, str, bool), variables and assignment, calling functions (print, int, str, float, type, isinstance, dir, id)

### p. 2: control flow
- **Concepts**: control flow
- **Python basics**: comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=), logical operators (and, not, or), conditionals (if..elif..else), while loops, lists (len, index), for loop

## Week 2: compound data types
**Problem Set**: identifying important words in text documents.

### p. 3: sequence types

- **Concepts**: ordering, indexing
- **Python strings**: string creation (', ", ''', f''), string methods (.lower(), .upper(), .isalpha(), .replace()),
- **Python sequence types**: sequence types in general, len, x in seq, .append(), .extend(), slicing [start:stop:step], for again

### p. 4: dictionaries, sets, and files
- **Concepts**: ordered vs not, hash
- **Python dict, set**: hashable, set, dict, .update(), del
- **Python files**: open, close, with open as fp

## Week 3: structuring programs
**Problem Set**: simulating interacting agents

### p. 5: functions
- **Concepts**: abstraction, functions, scope, mutable/immutable
- **Python functions**: writing, scope, pass by reference implications

### p. 6: objects
- **Concepts**: classes, objects, OO
- **Python classes/objects**: writing, attributes, methods, self, dunder (__str__())

## Week 4: data and visualization
**Problem Set**: summarize and plot data 

### p. 7: data frames
- **Concepts**: data frame/table, filtering
- **Python libraries**: import, as, from .. import .. as ..
- **Python pandas**: basics, slicing/indexing: [], .loc[,], .iloc[,], 

### p. 8: plotting
- **Concepts**: visualization, informative scientific graphics, 
- **Python matplotlib**

## Week 5: some data complexities
**Problem Set**: Merge, filter, sort, visualize data of different types.

### p. 9: joins, file types
- **Concepts**: File format
- **Python pandas**: joins, csv, json

## p. 10: beyond
- this day is used as slack in the event that
