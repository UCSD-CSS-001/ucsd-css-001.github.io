    "\n",
    "## Conceptual overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Container data types in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Atomic types** such as integers, floats, booleans, and a few other types in Python, are data types that have no substructure -- they are the smallest possible unit.  A boolean like True is a basic unit in Python: it has no parts.  Ditto for integers, floats, etc. (even though, mathematically, we could define \"parts\" to an integer, in the Python representation they have no parts).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Containers** are data types in Python that that **contain** multiple other objects.  Every container has the ability to be probed with the expression `x in container` (which will return True if `x` is an item in the container, and False otherwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collections** Are *containers* that have a few further properties: they have a *size*, indicating how many elements it contains (obtained via `len(x)`); and they can be *iterated* over (e.g., you can loop through all the items in a collection via a for loop `for item in collection:`...).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequences** are *collections* with a **deterministic order**, which means they can be **indexed** via an integer indicating the order of an element, with the notation `x[3]` and **sliced** via integer expressions to obtain subsequences.  Sequences can also be concatenated with the `+` operator.\n",
    "For instance, a list is a sequence, so you can ask for the initial item of a list via `x[3]`.  (In contrast, a `set` is a collection but not a sequence, so you cannot ask for a particular item via an index.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutable sequences** are *sequences* that can be changed after they are created (in contrast, immutable sequences cannot be changed, they can only be overwritten with a newly created immutable sequence). Mutable sequences have useful methods like `seq.append(item)` (add an item to the end of the sequence), `seq_1.extend(seq_2)` (add the items in seq_2 to the end of seq_1), `seq.pop(index)` (return the value of the item at index, and remove that item from the sequence), `seq.remove(item)` (remove the first item in the sequence that is equal to item), `seq.reverse()` to reverse the order of the sequence.  These are \"in place\" methods, in that they change the list in place, without returning a copy of the list.  In contrast, *immutable* sequence methods (such as those for *string*, have to return a new string with the change, because the original string cannot be changed).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strings** are immutable *sequences* of characters.  Each element of a string is a character.  Since they are a sequence, they can be indexed and sliced. Because they are immutable, you cannot change an element of a string, you can only create a new, different string.  Strings also have a number of very helpful methods for dealing with the text they represent, which we will cover below (since strings are immutable, methods that modify the string return a copy of a string with the modification, rather than changing the existing string in place).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lists** are *mutable sequences*, which can contain items of any type. They not only support indexing and slicing, but they can also be changed, reversed, appended to, extended, sorted, inserted into, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuples** are *immutable sequences*.  They have a number of uses which we may cover eventually.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sets** are *collections* of *unique* items.  They support useful [set operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset) like set union, set difference, subset evaluations, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dictionaries** are *collections* that are mappings.  They do not have a particular *order*, but items in a dictionary have a unique *key* which need not be an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing and slicing sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific elements of a sequence can be obtained by **indexing** -- referring to the specific order of that element in the sequence.  Python uses zero-based indexing, which means that the item at the start of the index has an index of 0, the next item has an index of 1, and so on. There are some [good reasons](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html) to index starting with 0, although not all programming languages adopt this convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subsequence can be obtained from a sequence by **slicing** -- referring to the set of indexes that you want to pull out.  A slice is defined with the notation `[start:stop:step]`, which we will cover in great detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings: defining / creating\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are immutable sequences of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A string can be created in python by putting some text in quotes.\n",
    "- You can use either single quotes (`'string'`), or double quotes (`\"string\"`), it does not matter so long as the start and end of the string match. The choice of single vs double quotes is arbitrary. Pick one and use it consistently.\n",
    "- Tripple quotes, where you repeat three quotes of the same type to start the string (e.g., : `'''string'''` or `\"\"\"string\"\"\"`) are a special string definition that allows the string to span multiple lines."
