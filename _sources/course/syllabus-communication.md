# How to Communicate

The instructors can be reached in the following ways:   

- Drop in during scheduled **office hours** (see [syllabus](syllabus.md) for links and schedule).  

- Public message on {{ url_campuswire }}.   

- Private "Instructors & TAs" message on {{ url_campuswire }}  

- Direct message to specific instructor on {{ url_campuswire }}  

Outside of office hours, all communication should happen over {{ url-campuswire }}.  Email is reserved for the unanticipated circumstances when campuswire is down, or you cannot access it.  In that case, [email the instructor](mailto:evul@ucsd.edu) about in inability to access Campuswire.

## Specific types of questions / comments

- **questions about course logistics:** First, check the syllabus and the detailed how-to pages on the {{ url_website }}. If you can't find the answer there, first ask a classmate. If still unsure, post on Campuswire in the General tag.
  
- **questions about course content:** these are awesome! We want everyone to see them, be able to answer them, and have their questions answered too, so post these to Campuswire with an appropriate tag!  

- **my code produces an error that I cannot fix:** follow the [debugging instructions](debugging.md) to find a minimal reproducible example and fill out the debugging question checklist, then post on Campuswire in the "Python" category or the relevant "Problem Set" category.

- **assignment clarification question:** Ask in the appropriate "Problem Set" or "Labs" category.  
  
- **a technical assignment question:** Come to office hours (or post to Campuswire). Answering technical questions is often best accomplished 'in person' where we can discuss the question and talk through ideas. However, if that is not possible, post your question to Campuswire. Be as specific as you can in the question you ask. And, for those answering, help your classmates as much as you can without just giving the answer. Help guide them, point them in a direction, provide pseudo code, but do not provide code that answers assignment questions.  
  
- **been stuck on something for a while (>30min) and aren't even really sure where to start** - Programming can be frustrating and it may not always be obvious what is going wrong or why something isn't working. That's OK - we've all been there! IF you are stuck, you can and should reach out for help, even if you aren't exactly sure what your specific question is. To determine when to reach out, consider the 2-hour rule. This rule states that if you are stuck, work on that problem for an hour. Then, take a 30 minute break and do something else. When you come back after your break, try for another 30 minutes or so to solve your problem while working through our [debugging](debugging.md) checklist. If you are still completely stuck, stop and contact us (office hours, post on Campuswire). If you don't have a specific question, include the information you have (what you're stuck on, the [debugging checklist](debugging.md)).
  
- **questions about a grade** - Post on Campuswire with the "Regrades" tag in a private post to "Instructors & TAs".
  
- **something super cool to share related to class or want to talk about a topic in further depth** - come to office hours, post in General, or send in a DM to the instructors!
  
- **feedback about the course you want to share anonymously:** - If you've been offended by an example in class, really liked or disliked a lesson, or wish there were something covered in class that wasn't but would rather not share this publicly, etc., please fill out the {{ url_feedback }}.  While UCSD login is required to access the form, your email is not associated with your responses -- your responses are anonymous.

### Campuswire Rules

Campuswire is an incredible resource for technical classes. It gives you a place to post questions and an opportunity to answer others' questions. We do our very best as an instructional staff to make sure each and every question is answered in a timely manner. We also want to make sure this platform is being used to learn and not thwarting anyone's education. To make all of this possible, there are a few rules for this course's campuswire:  

1. Before posting your question, look at questions that have already been posted to avoid duplicates.   
2. If posting about an assignment, note title should have assignment number, question number, and 1-2 words about the question. (i.e. PS01 Q1 Variable Naming)    
3. Never post an answer to or code for an assignment on a public post. Pseudocode is encouraged for public posts. If you must include code for an assignment, make this post private (to "Instructors & TAs" only) on Campuswire.   
   
4. Your post must include not only your question/where you're stuck, but also what you've already done to try to solve it so far and what resources (class notes, online URLs, etc.) you used to try to answer the question up to this point.  See how to ask [debugging questions](debugging.md).
