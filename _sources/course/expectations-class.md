# Class structure

Programming requires practice, and this class is structured to give you lots of practice programming.  You have opportunities to practice programming as a whole class in lecture, in small groups in labs, and on your own in problem sets.

## What we expect of you:

- Put in a good faith effort.  Go to lectures and labs (attendance is not required, but is noticed.)  
  
- Be brave.  Ask questions as soon as you have a slight inkling that you are confused.    
  
- Be proactive: Start assignments early, ask questions early.  If you skip lectures and labs, and put off working on assignments until the last minute, we will not be able to help you.  
  
- Persevere: You will make errors in your programs.  It will be frustrating, it will seem hopeless, you will want to give up.  Do not give up: keep trying and ask for help.

## What you can expect of us:

- Responsive: We will respond to questions on campuswire within one working day.

- Transparent and predictable grades.  Assignments are mostly auto-graded.  You should have a very good sense whether your solutions work for a given assignment before you turn that assignment in.

## How to succeed in this class.
- course is hard.
- read homework early, write pseudocode early, revise often
- code a lot, type, do examples form scratch, etc.
- learn to debug (read errors, print statements, pythontutor, rubber duck debugging)
