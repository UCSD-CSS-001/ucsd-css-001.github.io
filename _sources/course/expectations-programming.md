# Learning to program

## TL; DR:


- **Facts** are *declarative* knowledge: what things are true.  **Skills** are *procedural* knowledge: how to do things.

- Learning facts requires memorization.  Developing skills requires practice.  

- Computer programming is a skill.    
  
- Therefore, learning to program computers requires lots of practice writing computer programs. 


## Computer programming is a skill

Learning different topics requires some combination of acquiring new **skills** and committing to memory new **facts**, but the exact balance of skills and facts differs across domains.  Learning to write computer programs is primarily about acquiring a new **skill**, rather than memorizing new **fact**.  This emphasis on skills makes computer programming classes different from many other classes you may have taken.

## Learning facts vs Acquiring skills 

Skills are "procedural" knowledge -- they amount to learning *how* to do something.  Facts are "declarative" knowledge -- they amount to learning *what* statements are true. Acquiring and improving skills is different from learning facts.  

Consider a fact, such as "The Battle of Gettysburg happened July 1-3, 1863".  To learn it, you have to commit it to memory, and there are lots of strategies for memorizing things which apply equally well to all facts (e.g., write the fact on a flashcard and quiz yourself repeatedly).  It helps to have a larger understanding of the history of the US, and the American Civil War to remember this fact, but ultimately, you just have to remember the fact.   

Consider instead a skill, such as shooting a basketball free-throw.  To learn this skill you have to practice doing this skill, over and over and over again.  Your ability to shoot free throws will not improve much from studying flashcards about free-throw mechanics.  Likewise, learning all there is to know about the history of basketball, common basketball strategies and the role of free-throws in the game, etc. will also not make you better at shooting free throws.  You have to actually go to a basketball hoop and shoot many free-throws. **To acquire a skill uou have to practice.**  There is no substitute.

Likewise, to learn the skill of programming a computer, there is no substitute for writing many computer programs.  So, to teach you this skill, we need to give you ample opportunities (and incentives!) to practice.  **To this end, we have many problem sets, in-lab exercises, and ungraded practice opportunities.**
