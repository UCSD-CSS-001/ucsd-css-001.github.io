## Academic Integrity

[From UCSD Academic Integrity office](https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/take-action/promote-integrity/faculty/syllabus-statements.html#General-statement-on-academic-i)

> Integrity of scholarship is essential for an academic community. The University expects that both faculty and students will honor this principle and in so doing protect the validity of University intellectual work. For students, this means that all academic work will be done by the individual to whom it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any kind.

[Please read the full UCSD policy](http://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2)

You are encouraged to work together and help one another for *labs*. However, you are personally responsible for the work you submit. It is your responsibility to ensure you understand everything you've submitted.

**You must work independently on the problem sets and the final.**  You may ask and answer [debugging questions](debugging.md) on campuswire, but doing work for another student or providing assistance outside of public questions on campuswire on the problem sets or final project will be treated as a violation of academic integrity and you will be referred for disciplinary action. Similarly, emailing with or otherwise communicating with other students or anyone else during a quiz or exam will be treated as a violation and also referred for disciplinary action.   Cheating and plagiarism have been and will be strongly penalized. Please review academic integrity policies [here](http://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu).

You are responsible for ensuring that the correct file has been submitted and that the submission is uncorrupted. If, for whatever reason, Canvas or DataHub is down or something else prohibits you from being able to turn in an assignment on time, immediately contact the instructor by emailing the assignment, otherwise the assignment will be graded as late.


## Class Conduct

In all interactions in this class, you are expected to be respectful. This includes following the [UC San Diego principles of community](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html).
 
This class will be a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political beliefs/leanings, or technology choices.

At all times, you should be considerate and respectful. Always refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Last of all, take care of each other.

If you have a concern, please speak with Prof. Ellis, your TAs, or IAs. If you are uncomfortable doing so, that's OK! The [OPHD](https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/policies/sexual/OPHD.html) (Office for the Prevention of Sexual Harassment and Discrimination) and [CARE](https://care.ucsd.edu/) (confidential advocacy and education office for sexual violence and gender-based violence) are wonderful resources on campus.  


## Disability Access

Students requesting accommodations due to a disability must provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter. These letters are issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. Please make arrangements to contact Professor Ellis privately to arrange accommodations.

Contacting the OSD can help you further:
