# Schedule

This class is divided into 10 parts, corresponding to the normal 10 weeks of the academic year. Each part has associated lectures and labs.

**During summer session:**
- we cover two parts per week (one per day).  
  
- each week has a problem set motivating (and testing) the material that we cover that week.  

- each day contains lecture (introducing the concepts and methods), and lab (hands on, group practice culminating in a submitted notebook graded for completion)
