# Remote learning

For some of you, remote learning is new. For others, you've got a bit of practice. For all of us, there is a lot going on in the world. While students have always been under a fair amount of pressure and stress, the struggles students may encounter this quarter (for a whole bunch of different reasons) may go beyond what is typical. I want you all to know that I fully understand this and am here to help you succeed. 

While regular deadlines have been established to help keep you all on track, I want you to know up front that I am a very reasonable person. While I ask that you all do your best to meet deadlines that have been set, know that if you're struggling, I absolutely want you to reach out to let me know, to ask for an extension, or to discuss some other accommodation.

Please take care of yourselves and one another, and I'll work as hard as needed to ensure success for all students this quarter.

## Remote technology

If you do not have consistent access to the technology needed to fully access remote instruction options, please use the form below to request a loaner laptop for the period during which you will be learning remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic: [https://eforms.ucsd.edu/view.php?id=490887](https://eforms.ucsd.edu/view.php?id=490887). (For any issues that you may have, please email [vcsa@ucsd.edu](mailto:vcsa@ucsd.edu) and they will work to assist you.)


## Remote Lectures and Labs

Attendance will be neither required nor incentivized for any part of the course this quarter. This policy is in place because we do not want to disadvantage students working in different time zones. While lectures and coding labs will take place during their scheduled times, there *will* be options for students to complete all work asynchronously.

Lectures will take place at their scheduled time for those who are able to attend. As typically occurs in CSS 1, students will be encouraged to follow along with the notes, will be given time to complete small coding challenges during lecture on their own, and will have the opportunity to see their classmates thoughts during lecture.

However, every lecture will also be recorded and shared so that students who are not able to or choose not to watch during the scheduled class time are still able to receive and digest all class materials. If a lecture recording ever fails during class, instructors will re-record a lecture, ensuring all students have access to the material. Lecture and Lab recordings will be available on {{ url_canvas }} in the Media Gallery.
