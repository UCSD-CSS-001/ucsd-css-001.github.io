# Expectations

Computational Social Sciences is about using computation to understand social phenomena.  "Using computation" means giving a computer very precise instructions about what steps to follow to calculate something of interest.  This is what it means to "program" a computer.  In this class you will learn to write computer programs in Python.

## Computer Programming is a skill

Learning different topics requires some combination of acquiring new **skills** and committing to memory new **facts**, but the exact balance of skills and facts differs across domains.  Learning to write computer programs is primarily about acquiring a new **skill**, rather than memorizing new **fact**.  This emphasis on skills makes computer programming classes different from many other classes you may have taken.

### Skills vs facts 

Skills are "procedural" knowledge -- they amount to learning *how* to do something.  Facts are "declarative" knowledge -- they amount to learning *what* statements are true. Acquiring and improving skills is different from learning facts.  

Consider a fact, such as "Alice's birthday is April 17th".  To learn it, you have to commit it to memory, and there are lots of strategies for memorizing things which apply equally well to all facts (e.g., write the fact on a flashcard and quiz yourself repeatedly).    

Consider instead a skill, such as shooting a basketball free-throw.  To learn this skill you have to practice doing this skill, over and over and over again.  Your ability to shoot free throws will not improve much from studying flashcards about free-throw strategies, you have to actually go to a basketball hoop and shoot many free-throws.  

Likewise, to learn the skill of programming a computer, there is no substitute for writing many computer programs.  So, to teach you this skill, we need to give you ample opportunities (and incentives!) to practice.  **To this end, we have many problem sets, in-lab exercises, and ungraded practice opportunities.**

## Learning to Program

## What is the purpose of this class?

## How to succeed in this class.
- course is hard.
- read homework early, write pseudocode early, revise often
- code a lot, type, do examples form scratch, etc.
- learn to debug (read errors, print statements, pythontutor, rubber duck debugging)



## Structure of this class

The structure of this class is dictated by our goal: teaching you how to write computer programs in Python.

# Facts vs skills

## TL; DR:

- Facts are *declarative* knowledge: what things are true.  Skills are *procedural* knowledge: how to do things.

- Learning facts requires memorization.  Learning skills requires practice.  

- Many classes you have taken teach you facts, rather than skills.  Skill-based classes are different, and may be harder if you are not used to the demands of skill learning.

- Computer programming is a skill.  This class aims to teach computer programming, therefore this class requires lots of practice.

## Preliminary notes

Course topics vary along a continuum between "facts" and "skills".  
For instance, a course on the history of world war II will be full of facts: names, places, dates, strung into sequences, narratives, etc. The whole point of the course is learning this vast array of facts and how they stick together in a coherent model of the world. 
In contrast, a gymnastics course is primarily about skills: learning the names of movements is trivial, the objective is to learn to *do* those movements.

We can consider where different classes fall along this continuum:
history vs 
psychology vs research methods
literature vs writing
astronomy vs orbital mechanics
math
programming
engineering
essay writing
foreign language
running
weight-lifting

Fact-based courses are relatively easy for everyone involved.  There is relatively little variation in individuals' ability to read and commit facts to memory, so people start at roughly the same level, learn at roughly the same rate, etc.  For instructors, the goal is to make the acquisition of facts *fun*.  There are popular books, movies, podcasts, youtube channels dedicated to edutainment -- conveying interesting facts in an engaging, fun way.  I confess: I love edutainment.  
Furthermore, it is very easy to test people on facts.  
So it is very tempting to make every class be a fact class.  

There is a cost, however: if you take only fact classes, you don't gain any skills.  And, for the most part, skills are what make you valuable.



It's not really obvious, because we talk about "knowledge workers", and that implies that we need workers with lots of facts.  But that's a fundamental misunderstanding. "Knowledge workers" are people who work with knowledge and information.  In the same way as carpenters work with lumber.  A carpenter does not need to acquire a huge stockpile of lumber to be useful, a carpenter needs to learn a set of skills to be able to work with lumber in general, so that they might, for instance, frame a house.  To do so, it doesn't matter how much lumber a carpenter has -- lumber is a generic input, that might vary depending on the house plans.  In contrast, sawing, nailing, scribing, etc. are all skills that a carpenter needs to acquire.  
There are lots of facts a carpenter may need to remember and have easily accessible, such as details of building codes, generic plans for arranging lumber into walls, etc.  But Likewise, a knowledge worker facts


## What are skills?

Motor memory: kind of a cached lookup table of controls and procedures.

Making some aspects of execution somewhat automated and unconscious.

In carpentry:
- skilled carpenter: can spend a lot of time thinking about the goal, the design, the structure, and little time thinking about the details of how to saw, how to nail, etc.

In programming: 
- knowing the syntax fluently enough that you think about the algorithm rather than the individual steps.

## Getting skills

skills come from practice, but why?

- implicit memory... 

- partly this is just commiting to implicit memory all the repeated parts.

- partly this is about executing the same thing better by learning which strategies worked better in the past.  it is impossible to teach this in a fact-based way, because the circumstances vary.  Consider writing a sentence well.  Or lifting a 

- partly this is about encountering a wide array of circumstances, so as to be stumped less often.  (this is experience)
