# Datahub assignments

This is a guide to submitting assignments on datahub.

## Overview  

**Technical overview:**  Assignments are [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) served from a class-specific [container](https://docs.docker.com/) on UCSD's [datahub](https://datahub.ucsd.edu), and automatically graded by [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).     

**Practical overview:**  To complete an assigment you will need to:    
1. **log in to [datahub](https://datahub.ucsd.edu):**  If you are enrolled in the class, you should be able to log in using your UCSD credentials (username@ucsd.edu, and your password)    
1. **launch this class environment:** select...   
1. **open the assignment:** click on x. then y.     
1. **complete the assignment:** by following instructions in the notebook (more below), save regularly.  
1. **check your work:** re-read questions and instructions; restart kernel and rerun all cells; look over results; validate notebook.
1. **save your work and submit:**  step step step.

Below we write this steps out in more detail.

### Printing Variables

A reminder that you can (and should) print and check variables as you go.

This allows you to check what values they hold, and fix things if anything unexpected happens.

#%%

# Define a variable
math_result = 2 * 4

# Print out the value(s) of a variable.
print(math_result)

#%% md

### Restarting the Kernel

A reminder that sometimes if you run cells out of order, you can end up overwriting things in your namespace.

If things seem to go weird, a good first step is to restart the kernel, which you can do from the kernel menu above.

Even if everything seems to be working, it's a nice check to 'Restart & Run All' to make sure everything runs properly in order.
